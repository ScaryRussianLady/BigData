# 5011ModuleCode

The goal of this project was to investiage the us of Big Data technioques to reduce the processing time. The European Centre for
Medium Range eather Forecasts (ECMWF) had an analysis technique that took too long to run - their target processing time was under 2
hours for a 24-hour data slot. Running these files automatically estimates the number of processors that would be required to achieve their goal.

The five SMART Targets that have been chosen for the project are:
  1.	Ensure that any function created is separated into an individual file â€“ this must be done as soon as the task has started. This will avoid any errors harming the main files
  and/or any other files. Alongside that, it will allow for easier re-use across the entire project.

  2.	Comment any code written that would be essential in understanding what is going on, it must be concise. This includes adding sections to the code and describing what they
  do/will do. In doing so, if the project is passed along to another individual, they will be able to get a better grasp of the written code.

  3.	Matlab R2020a must be used when running any script files. Matlab provides backwards compatibility so if a later version is used, it can be reversed back to Matlab R2020a.
  Using the appropriate version reduces the possibility of errors; the code has been written using this version of the software.

  4.	Push and commit changes to GitHub once any sort of file has been modified, the commit note must include the file version (incremental in the progression of modifications),
  where the change was made and why it was done. This will create a detailed network of all changes made to the repository.

  5.Parallel processing must successfully measure at least three different data sizes: 500, 1,000 and 5,000. There should be no errors from Matlab R2020a, instead a consistent
  display of results should be shown in the terminal with the appropriate processing time (they will seem logical and realistic). These results will be stored into an array for
  that iteration and later displayed on a graph that can be held long-term to prove the success of measurement in processing time.
